# eVote Frontend Migration - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document outlines the changes made to migrate the frontend from the old eVote API endpoint to the new statistics API, ensuring that eVotes are properly handled according to the updated requirements.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `evotesService` (`/src/services/evotes.ts`)

#### Removed:
- `checkEvoteStatus(representativeId)` method that called `/representatives/{representative_id}/evote/status`

#### Added:
- Import statements for `AccountStatsRequest`, `AccountStatsResponse` types and `userService`
- `getEvoteDataFromStatsAPI(representativeId)` method that:
  - Creates a stats request for the representative
  - Calls the new `POST /accounts/stats` API via `userService.getAccountStats()`
  - Extracts eVote data from the response:
    - Total eVotes from `metrics` array (key: 'total_evotes')
    - User vote status from `evotes` field (for checking if current user has voted)
  - Returns structured data: `{ has_voted: boolean, total_count: number }`

### 2. Updated `VotingButton` Component (`/src/components/VotingButton.tsx`)

#### Changed:
- Modified `getInitialState()` useEffect to use `evotesService.getEvoteDataFromStatsAPI()` instead of parallel calls to `checkEvoteStatus()` and `getRepresentativeEvoteTrends()`
- Simplified the data fetching logic to use a single API call
- Maintained the same UI behavior and optimistic updates

### 3. Removed eVotes Field Display from UI Components

#### `Profile.tsx` (`/src/pages/Profile.tsx`):
- Removed the entire eVotes display section that showed `userStats?.evotes`
- This ensures the `evotes` field from the stats response is not displayed in the UI

#### `UserProfile.tsx` (`/src/pages/UserProfile.tsx`):
- Removed the eVotes display section that showed `userStats?.evotes`
- Maintains consistency with the profile page

#### `AccountStatsCard.tsx` (`/src/components/AccountStatsCard.tsx`):
- Removed the "Electoral Support" section that displayed the `evotes` field
- Only the `metrics` array is now displayed, ensuring compliance with the requirement

### 4. API Integration Points

#### Current API Usage:
- **Stats API**: `POST /accounts/stats` - Used for fetching all account statistics including eVote metrics
- **eVote Actions**: `POST/DELETE /representatives/{id}/evote` - Still used for casting/removing votes
- **eVote Trends**: `GET /representatives/{id}/evote-trends` - Still used for graph displays

#### Removed API Usage:
- **eVote Status**: `GET /representatives/{id}/evote/status` - No longer used anywhere in the frontend

### 5. Data Flow Updates

#### Before:
```
VotingButton → checkEvoteStatus() → /representatives/{id}/evote/status
           → getRepresentativeEvoteTrends() → /representatives/{id}/evote-trends
UI Components → Display userStats.evotes field
```

#### After:
```
VotingButton → getEvoteDataFromStatsAPI() → POST /accounts/stats
UI Components → Display only userStats.metrics (evotes field ignored)
GraphModal → getRepresentativeEvoteTrends() → /representatives/{id}/evote-trends (unchanged)
```

## Key Benefits

1. **Unified API**: All eVote data now comes from the consistent stats API
2. **Proper Data Separation**: The `evotes` field is used only for internal logic, not UI display
3. **Simplified Code**: Reduced complexity by eliminating parallel API calls
4. **Future-Proof**: Built on the new stats architecture that supports multiple account types
5. **Performance**: Single API call instead of multiple parallel requests

## Testing Verification

A test script (`test-evote-migration.js`) was created and successfully run to verify:
- ✅ Old `checkEvoteStatus` method is properly deprecated
- ✅ New `getEvoteDataFromStatsAPI` method works correctly
- ✅ Returns expected data structure
- ✅ All UI components updated to hide `evotes` field
- ✅ Only `metrics` are displayed in the UI

## Migration Compliance

The implementation fully addresses the requirements:

1. ✅ **Old API Removed**: The `GET /representatives/{representative_id}/evote/status` endpoint is no longer used
2. ✅ **New Stats API Used**: eVote data is now fetched via the new statistics API
3. ✅ **Metrics Only**: Only the metrics inside `data.metrics` are displayed in the UI
4. ✅ **eVotes Field Hidden**: The `evotes` field in the response is not displayed in the UI
5. ✅ **Separate Handling**: eVotes are handled separately and fetched via the stats API

## Files Modified

1. `/src/services/evotes.ts` - Updated service methods
2. `/src/components/VotingButton.tsx` - Updated to use new API
3. `/src/pages/Profile.tsx` - Removed evotes field display
4. `/src/pages/UserProfile.tsx` - Removed evotes field display  
5. `/src/components/AccountStatsCard.tsx` - Removed evotes field display
6. `/test-evote-migration.js` - Created test verification script

## Backward Compatibility

- The eVote casting/removing functionality (`POST/DELETE /representatives/{id}/evote`) remains unchanged
- The trends API (`GET /representatives/{id}/evote-trends`) remains unchanged for graph displays
- All existing UI interactions continue to work as expected
- The migration is transparent to end users

This migration successfully modernizes the eVote handling system while maintaining all existing functionality and improving the overall architecture.
