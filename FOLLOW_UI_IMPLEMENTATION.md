## Testing Considerations
- Unit tests for components
- Integration tests for user flows
- API mocking for development
- Error scenario testing
- Performance testing with large lists
- Accessibility testing with screen readers

## Backend Integration
All components are designed to work with the existing backend API endpoints:
- `POST /api/v1/follows/{user_id}` - Follow user
- `DELETE /api/v1/follows/{user_id}` - Unfollow user
- `GET /api/v1/follows/{user_id}/followers` - Get followers
- `GET /api/v1/follows/{user_id}/following` - Get following
- `GET /api/v1/follows/{user_id}/stats` - Get follow stats
- `GET /api/v1/follows/{user_id}/status` - Get follow status

The UI automatically handles authentication, pagination, error states, and data synchronization with the backend.
